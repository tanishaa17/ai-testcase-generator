Requirement: User Profile Picture Upload

  User Story:
  As a registered user, I want to upload a profile picture to my account so that other users can identify me more easily and my profile feels more personalized.

  Acceptance Criteria:

   1. The user must be able to select an image file from their local machine via an "Upload Image" button on their profile page.
   2. The system shall display a preview of the selected image before the user confirms the upload.
   3. The system must only accept image files with the extensions .jpg, .jpeg, or .png.
   4. The system must reject any file that is larger than 5 MB and display a user-friendly error message (e.g., "File size cannot exceed 5 MB").
   5. The system must reject any file that is not one of the accepted types and display a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Invalid file type. Please upload a JPG or PNG.").
   6. Upon successful upload, the new profile picture shall be displayed on the user's profile page immediately.
   7. A success message (e.g., "Profile picture updated successfully!") shall be displayed to the user upon successful upload.
   8. If the upload process fails for any server-side reason, a generic error message (e.g., "An error occurred while uploading. Please try again.") shall be displayed.
   9. The uploaded image must be stored securely in the system's backend storage.
